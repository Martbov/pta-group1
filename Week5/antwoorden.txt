It could be possible, some senses for the same word are very similar. As in the example for ‘bronze’ in exercise 5, both senses are very similar and a small change in context may result in choosing another sense. It seems we took the entire wikipedia text for every annotation we had. Therefore, the context used is every sentence on the wikipedia page.

7.
Yes, because of the differences in context it is possible that the same words get a different sense. (because of huge amount of data we now have it’s impossible to check)

8.
The use of disambiguation can be very helpful for our wikification project, provided that we use it the right way. As mentioned above, the way we’ve used the wikipedia texts it is not very effective. We should only use the abstract or the short introduction of the wikipedia page because otherwise there would simply be too much data.
